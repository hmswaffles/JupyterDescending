 - **Why 42 is a Good Minimum Sample Size.** 42 turns out to be the average minimum number of samples you'd need to have at least a 99% chance of detecting whether your samples came from a cauchy distribution or a normal distribution. In the former case, the central limit theorem does not hold, and various statistical tests don't apply. I have tried to track down where the 'you need at least 30 data points' rule of thumb comes from, but I can't find a reliable source. It's also, by this logic, wrong. Distinguishing between Cauchy and Normal may not be the final word for what makes a "good" minimum sample size, as the real question has to do with what a researcher believes. If the researcher believes that the world is a little more diabolical, or that variables of interest are the result of a ratio between two normally distributed random samples, then 42 might be a good minimum sample size.
